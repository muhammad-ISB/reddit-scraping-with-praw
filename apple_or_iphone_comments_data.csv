Naturally, the airline messed up and our bags didn't arrive with us. Bags arrived 3 days later, but probably fell off a conveyor belt because we watched the airtags just sit outside a terminal for over a week. Repeated calls to the airport and airline yielded nothing, everyone claimed it was someone else's problem. Even when we explained the bags aren't lost, we can literally see their location at the airport, they'd be like ""oh yeah well we can't go get them"" for whatever bullshit reason. Kept trying to get me to submit a lost luggage claim, probably so they could write it off and stop dealing with me. Finally got someone willing to make an effort, about 10 days later.

I worked as a costumer service rep for a baggage handler company, and the airlines would not give us any information about the bags. The airlines would make promises that the bag would be with the owners in 48 hours, but honestly that was the exception not the rule. They were (and probably still are) too useless to handle anyone's bags. But I do recommend to have a list of everything in your bag, because that helps with 2 things, first to identify the bag (because they do go through your bag when they find it) and second when you inevitably have to make a claim for the bag

Flying needs a complete overhaul, the system is embarrassingly bad-globally. People can't just fly another day, or give up an entire checked bag of personal items just because some underpaid airline worker has been trained PURPOSELY not to help. 

The worst part is that good ol' capitalism will make any improvements another justification for raising already high prices.

10c7dvd,"Sorry, Apple — a portless iPhone is a terrible idea","What's funny is all the speculation here in these comments is conspiracy theory thinking.

1. there is no credible evidence that Apple is going portless.  Sure, there are reports that apple has a portless iPhone, but there are also reports that apple has a USB C iPhone, a foldable iPad, and a bunch of other things.  *These are prototypes*.  Of course Apple has them floating around, it's what a design team does, they try things out.  Doesn't mean they are going to ship them.  You all get sucked into articles that fit your narrative that absolutely everything Apple does is to lock people in and make them suffer, which is stupid to think.
2. There are too many use cases where USB is needed.  Professional data transfer, fastest possible charging, programming interfaces, wired audio needs, etc.  Contact wireless is not good enough for this yet.  Maybe one day, but it needs to address certain things that Magsafe is horrible at.  Apple could do this with the headphone jack because they had the charging port to fall back on, and because it was less important.
3. To all you people who think Apple is locking you into a proprietary connector, Apple is contributing it's magsafe to the Qi 2 standard.  Yes that's right, Apple is helping provide it's technology to a standard, so how exactly will they lock people in?

I have all the mount things in the car  and tabletop wireless charger stands but in my physical world, the tether works best and it has the added practical bonus of charging and electronic connection for data purposes etc. 

AirPods? Madness for me. They do not stay in my ears without added silicone things and left untethered, they are garanteed to be lost on day 1.  I have acceptable wireless off brand earbuds which are attached to a wire around the back of the neck. I miss the olden days when I could just plug them into the phone.

11283q1,50% rejection rate for iPhone casings produced in India shows scale of Apple’s challenge.,"This will always be the problem with shipping work to low-cost delivery centers. In a different scenario years ago, when I worked in film VFX and we had a job converting movies into 3D stereo in cooperation with an Indian studio. This was right after Avatar came out, and every major studio was in a race to pump out 3D movies to cinemas. Cost and logistics were two main obstacles to making 3D movies since 1. Stereo film cameras were very expensive, and 2. They were limited in supply even if a production could afford one. The alternative to shooting in 3D was called 3D stereo conversion. This is when you take standard 2D shot films and spend an unhealthy amount of man hours doing 3D match-move, rotoscoping, rigging/animations, and rendering an L&R depth pass for every single shot. 
To make this cost effective, the big studios would offshore the bulk of this work to places like India. On one such project, the shots we received back from the Indian team were so bad that they had to be sent back and remade. I asked my boss, how could the studio allow this waste of time and money? He replied that the Indians were so cheap that they could redo every shot in the entire film three times over, and it would still be cost-effective. This obviously doesn't work if you are working on a tight schedule, but I was blown away by that answer, and it looks like not much has changed.",bitwarrior80,402,1676398470.0

11283q1,50% rejection rate for iPhone casings produced in India shows scale of Apple’s challenge.,"This thread has odd extrapolations of people's bottom of the barrel experiences with Indian tech consultancies in the US.

India is actually pretty great at manufacturing. In tech, Indian consultancies cater to the lowest common denominator while all competent engineers work for well paying Indian startups or move to the US to work for FAANG companies. On the contrary, in manufacturing, top Indian engineers stay in India and are of a generally much much higher caliber.                
For ex: TCE (Tata consulting engineers), Tata Steel & Tata Motors have much more competent employees than TCS (Tata Consultancy). 

As of 2023, India is a world leader in automobile, FMCG & pharmaceutical manufacturing. Indian civil engineers are also handling some of the most ambitious metro projects in India & infrastructure projects in the middle east.                          
The bottle neck is the assembly workers. While India has great engineers, training top quality 'assembly workers' for electronics assembly takes time. These jobs don't require education, and the only way to learn is on the job. I expect India to start catching up in the electronics space soon. But, yeah, there will be growing pains for good decade.

10sk434,Apple sales drop 5% in largest quarterly revenue decline since 2016,"I think Apple has mess up a lot of their product releases in the last year. 

1 - iPhone 14 that is literally an iPhone 13 with a few tiny feature changes

2 - iPhone 14 Pro stock issues, with again not a huge departure from the 13 Pro's. 

3 - Crippling the base model refreshed MacBook SSD speeds. I know a few people personally that ended up going with a M1 14"" over the new released M2 14"" because they halved the SSD speeds. Why pay $400 more (given the M1 has been on sale for $1600) for marginal CPU performance upgrades and slower SSD speeds?

4 - Raising the price of the base MacBook Air M2 to $1200. Sorry, a $1200 laptop needs more than 8GB of RAM and/or 256GB of storage and certainly isn't worth the premium over the old M1 MBA. Also, upgrading it to 16/512 is literally the same price as the M1 Pro 14 has been at for a significantly better laptop.",caverunner17,22,1675440872.0

Apple will be fine. Their sales drop was due to supply chain disruptions in China, and this just means that sales will pick up in the next, because Apple users typically don't switch platforms; they just defer their purchases till the next upgrade.

I’m sure there’s plenty of enhancements that can still be useful in an iPhone, but I believe they’ve committed to the capabilities of a headset and the goal will be to transition folks over time. 

Slow roll process with functions that can be utilized from iPhone to headset (like spatial videos). 

First gen adopters are the ones basically promoting it to the masses. 

Pro version and then a standard and then an SE. 

Then maybe glasses come out as a new technology transition (or an alternative option other than a headset).

faster cpu with av1 encoding and some serious computational chops

on-device Siri, which will be a huge improvement (and they've been spending $1M a day on conversational LLM's from what I read, so I imagine Siri will be improved in many ways)

the ability to beam a damn satellite for emergency situations

OLED on the non-pro model now

despite non-pro model getting last year's pro SoC, it's still equal to or faster than most of the android SoC's, so it doesn't really matter in nearly every scenario for most people

allegedly stronger glass

lighter from use of titanium

better repairability via removable back glass

brighter peak brightness hitting 2000 nits in direct sunlight.  that's a massive brightness by the way.  the average cheap computer monitor is 200 nits, for reference

improved camera, and up to 5x telephoto for crazy 120mm equivalent shots on the pro max model

ability to write proraw video straight to external storage will make this an amateur videographer's gateway device, and should be able to do plenty for starting out, especially since iPhone has always excelled at video recording almost without competition 

ability to change focus after a shot is really epic

price stayed the same.  the pro max looks like it went up $100, but they really just got rid of the 128gb option and shifted it up, so the base 256gb model is the same price as the last gen one was for 256gb, so technically the same, but I can see the argument in both directions, but all things considered, it's the flagship and I think they can get away with it

improved wifi 6e mimo for higher than gigabit speeds

ability to record stereoscopic 3d video for use with vision pro headset

When they launched the same happened as with the PC's between the 80s and 2k. Every new gen had new features and so much more performance, that your device was obsolete by the time you walked past the cashier and left the store.

Now the CPU's reached the limit we had with x86 (PCs) for a long time - small, increment improvements. Same goes with components. At first there was a new finger print scanner. That got improved for quality and it moved behind the display in some cases.

For now we reached a point where we can't improve much anymore, as the space is limited in the phones and we already have really optimized components. There might me small increments to it, but nothing that makes you want the new phone.

And I honestly doubt, we will see  a ""must have"" hardware feature in the foreseeable future.

The only thing they can really improve on is software / AI, but I'm not sure, what you could do with it, to create a function you really crave for. You want, you need.

116cqrg,Leaked image appears to show iPhone 15 Pro with USB-C port and titanium design,"As soon as next year, it is mandated in the EU that portable devices must have a common charging standard, that being USB-C.

[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024)

I am relatively certain that Apple and other similar corpo-villains will hobble the principle, not provide facility X or Y that can otherwise be provided by USB-C, but that remains to be seen. The kneecapping of the right to repair bill in the US is prime example. Relatedly, portable devices in the EU will need accessible, replaceable batteries along with a ""battery passport"" dealing with specifics such as constituents, recycling methods, etc. However you slice it, these are positives for the end user and the more-responsible production of devices that easily end up as e-waste when the most simple and otherwise-repairable component fails or degrades.

I may not be entirely accurate or complete in this, however the EU is moving in this direction and I presume that this leaked ""Apple device with USB-C"" is a consequence of that. Whether Apple with change direction in this regard is unknown, but likely to still contain significant resistance. They'll do the bare minimum and only serve the legislated requirements as much as it serves them. Not the end user.",Prostheta,2,1676881692.0

I can only figure they discourage this because they want you to buy a new phone. With the new battery, I’ll continue using my 12 pro for at least another 1-2 years, which of course Apple doesn’t want.

11e3m7p,iPhone 15 to require certified accessories for full access to USB-C,"From the article: According to a rumor, Apple is resuming the Made For iPhone program despite moving from Lightning to USB-C on iPhone 15.

Apple requires third-party accessory makers to pay a fee to get certified access to select parts and technologies like the Lightning connector. This system is called the Made For iPhone program, and it was thought to be going away thanks to USB-C, but a repeated rumor says otherwise.

According to leaker ShrimpApplePro on Twitter, Apple will be requiring MFi certification for products connecting to the iPhone 15. This has been confirmed by the leaker's source, stating that Foxconn is in mass production of accessories like EarPods and cables with the certification.

The leaker does offer a bright side to the matter — some third-party MFi products are cheaper than Apple's official ones.

In the replies, Shrimp states that Apple will limit data and charging speed for cables connected to iPhone without the MFi certification. It seems this will be allowed, as Apple will be cooperating with the EU mandate to move to USB-C, just providing an obstacle to users.",chrisdh79,1577,1677583254.0

11e3m7p,iPhone 15 to require certified accessories for full access to USB-C,"Imagine Mercedes releasing a car that only has full power available that you paid for when you use their super duper AMG gasoline that is 50x more expensive and all it changes from normal gasoline is color. Car recognizes this color and decides how much power to let you use. You are not in control of it. The brand is in control of you and your wallet. And Mercedes would make marketing videos claiming how bad for your car those other pesky gasoline versions from other brands are, and how their own gives so much more power (because they limited others).

This is what Apple will do with USB-C. If you are fine with Apple, you are fine with Mercedes.

Or your printer refusing to print with any other cartridges that are not the $200 ones from their own brand, no matter how good quality the current ink is.

Or your computer not turning on because your electricity provider is not ""ASUS certified partner"" so it assumes the electricity is not safe to be used and refuses to turn on. And the ""partner"" is 2x more expensive for the same exact service.

Or your League of Legends not letting you gain ranked points after a match because your $150 mouse is not CERTIFIED FOR LEAGUE OF LEGENDS. You need their $200 mouse, an exact copy of yours just with the word ""certified"" on it's box.

I can go on. If you are fine with Apple, you are fine with a world like this too.

Don't buy MFi products. Vote with your wallet. Avoid Apple products, until Apple stops milking you so much. They won't stop if we don't stop.

Edit: I posted this exact same comment in the exact same news article in [r/apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple) and I am getting a lot of downvotes with comments to mine saying stuff like ""it's fine as long as apple includes their new usb-c braided in the box with the iPhone"" or ""it's ok because Apple will make sure the certified cables are good and you can trust them"".

On the way she said she left something at school (she was a middle school guidance counselor.) she told me to come into the office, my friend Sarah from high school was their new school nurse. And hey let’s check your blood pressure while we’re here (my ankles and legs were swollen AF but they always were at that point). 

When we passed the restaurant, I asked where we were going and my mom said not to freak out, but my blood pressure was a little high and she was just taking me to the ER to get checked out.

They took one look at my stats when I got there and told me to call my husband. Tried to induce but whenever I had a contraction the baby’s heart stopped beating, so they cut me open and ripped her out of me (before the epidural had time to work. I felt it all.)

Never let your general practitioners or specialists know you have PTSD. It doesn’t matter that lifelong child abuse is actually linked to multiple illnesses and lifelong physical health problems.

13kwq0v,‘We are losing money’: companies in Apple’s repair program say they can’t compete with tech giant,"That was the case when I worked for Apple about decade ago. There's big financial pitfalls for AASPs. They used to not want to touch obvious repairs without guarantees Apple wouldn't find a reason to not pay them for the repair they just did. It was common for one to call AppleCare, request a senior, and ensure they got a CS Code or CRU product. They would lose business because they couldn't safely pick up repairs they new were warranty covered because Apple would figure out a way to say it wasn't covered and charge them the parts they used to repair and obviously not pay them for completing the job, forcing them to push customers to pay the outrageous out of warranty repair prices or device replacement costs for basic repairs, turning them away. If the customer paid, Apple got big profit.

If they got busted for using senior techs, they'd lose their Apple Authorised Service Provider status, but many opted to drop it for unofficial repairs instead and just advise customers their limited and short warranty would drop, but they'd save hundreds.

For a while there, I had to cover comms with APACs engineering HQ in SGP (above seniors) as they were in on it too, but Cupertino kept investigating why there were lower than expected repair profits in the region. They even tried tactics like allowing free cheap products like iPod Nanos to be given away to customers that were challenging the repair costs, so they'd pay an out of warranty cost for an in-warranty issue, ensuring the AASPs generated (overall) more revenue. Techs nicknamed it ""iPod Friday"" where all the incidents over the week AASPs were challenged with would all get offered a crappy Nano and it was the AASPs job to then pitch that as Apple ""meeting halfway"" as a gesture of goodwill.

If AASPs couldn't convince their customers of that, they knew Apple wasn't going to honour the repair request, so they'd basically lose a customer or be out of pocket.

Edit: I have so much more of this. Don't get me started. Of all the evil companies Ive worked with or for, Apple's the paragon. and how they're good at covering it and what they do, shit's just the surface. I remember signing my many NDAs (now all expired) being told, ""It's funny. If you ever get in court, Apple's got your back. If you're the one against them, they'll destroy you. Pay attention to these."" I'm still scared to say more because I know what they've done to employees and ex-employees on my lebel that do.

I remember owning an iMac back in 2012 and since year one, I had over-heating issues with it which eventually became so bad that the GPU desoldered itself from the board.

If you have the option to repair it yourself or send it in to the manufacturer for repair, then why is this third party repair option important enough for someone to care about?

ETA: if the laws make repair info and parts available to consumers, then why make companies also support these third party stores with training, certifications and discounts on parts? Electronics just don’t need maintenance often enough to justify laws protecting a silly 3rd party repair option IMO.

The laws need to focus on making parts and repair procedures available to everyone, not special programs for 3rd party electronics shops. If there is value in this work then the availability in parts will maintain the market for the repair shops on its own. I don’t understand why everyone in here is crying for a law that is only designed to increase profits for those shops, not help the consumer.

10thv3b,First responders slam false iPhone Crash Detection alerts: ‘I’m struggling to get my daily job done’,"My GF works in German emergency service. She has never told me about such issues.
She mentioned, though, that in the first few weeks, there were a few false calls from people(s watches) on roller coasters, but nothing major. 
But maybe this is to people here being extremely respectful and responsible when it comes to Emergency services, and they possibly keep an eye on the watch/phone more and then disarming it before it calls 911. 

I, for once, fell off my bike pretty badly and my watch immediately asked if I was okay, and if I hadn’t answered, it would have called for help. It was a bad fall and if I had been unconscious or unable to call help for myself it probably would have been at least 5 hours until someone would have come along to find me.
So, what I'm saying is, as long as this doesn’t escalate to a bad degree here, I'm a big fan of this because I’d rather have them come to find someone hurt but okay (or on a roller coaster) then to have someone die on a bike path.

Furthermore, I have to mention, I'm wearing the watch Ultra for like 3 months now and never has it made a wrong call on this. Even when working out, boxing or even faking a fall.

Our SOP now is to log the call, the callback number, and the coordinates — and then do nothing. Because 99% of the time it has been false alarms, and the 1% of the time it *is* a real call, someone else calls it in while I’m still on the phone with 911. It ties up a 911 operator (people are already being put on hold or sent to voicemail when they try to call 911 because they’re over-worked and under-staffed), it ties up my phone (it’s usually just one or two dispatchers at any given time, meaning we can’t respond to other injuries, broken down lifts, etc), and if I send patrol to check it out it ties up a patroller who may be needed elsewhere.

When the iPhone 14 was first released it had issues at Amusement Parks, I witnessed one false positive first-hand. I believe they have Geolocation set to disable crash detection for Amusement parks now, but at a Ski resort it's a tougher question, yes, you're going to have more false positives, but the likelihood of someone being severely hurt, alone, and being unable to make a call themselves is much higher, add in dangerous weather, and If I were Apple I would have kept the feature ON.

10thv3b,First responders slam false iPhone Crash Detection alerts: ‘I’m struggling to get my daily job done’,"Meanwhile in local news here in Australia we had a recent news article praising the system because it meant that when 4 young people were involved in a rural crash recently, first responders were able to reach the scene within 8 min.

Plenty of mountain road trips I've been on where if I'd had a crash, I would of had no hope of being rescued in time. The motorcycle accident I did have I had to come to first, call first responders myself, and then wait 30min for them to arrive. If I'd actually had internal injuries or otherwise lost access to my phone I'd have been in a world of trouble and this system would of been critical to my survival.

There's pros and cons. New systems always need to go through a few rounds of improvements to iron out the more glaring bugs. But how much inconvenience is worth a life saved that wouldn't of been otherwise?",SiIverwolf,4,1675558458.0

I said this months ago and got downvoted to hell. Apple has been paying a FORTUNE to get ~~ads~~ ""articles"" written that tell stories about how someone's life was saved by their Apple watch.

It's neat and all, and I don't doubt that the stories are real, but it was CLEARLY marketing that was pushing those articles and suppressing articles like this about the downsides to that.

Now don't get me wrong here, I actually think it's awesome that watches do all these things and can monitor us safely now.

18bcl9n,Apple isn't happy about India's demand to upgrade older iPhones with USB-C,"From the article: Apple has urged the Indian IT ministry to make changes to its single charger rules, as adding USB-C to older iPhone models will make it hard for Apple to meet production targets for India's manufacturing and export laws.

Following after the European Union's introduction of regulations that will force electronics producers to use USB-C as part of a common charger directive, India followed suit with its own variation of the mandate. However, Apple is one of the few companies pushing back on its implementation.

Apple met with India's IT ministry in a closed-door meeting on November 28, reports Reuters, asking officials to add exemptions to the rules for some older models of iPhone.

While the EU's rules effectively apply only against newly designed and released products after the rules come into force in 2024, India's version does not. Instead, it applies to all electronic devices sold in the country, which also includes hardware that wasn't previously designed with USB-C.",chrisdh79,1443,1701786435.0

Currently they sell 15, 14, 13, & SE.  each year one will fall off and another new USBC phone will be added. So in 3 years nearly everything should be USBC across the lineup.

Why allow ANY company to manufacture products that are already being made to an obsolete standard.  We KNOW that USB-C is in all iphone and ipad's future.. why sell any products with a connector that is obsolete?  


I know why, of course: To differentiate the newer products from the older ones and to create a more compelling reason to purchase the more expensive and ""future-proof"" phone or tablet.  


In my mind this amounts to willingly creating extra e-waste and Apple is full of shit whenever they publish their sustainability reports every year, etc.  


If they sincerely cared about minimizing waste and e-waste they would make these minimal changes to the cheap phones so that people buying the cheaper phones now aren't compelled to upgrade prematurely... or the phones stay in use longer (on resale, etc.)

As far as the iPhone goes, I could not care less. I can't think of any way this would have an impact on my life. MagSafe works for me. I mean, I can't deny everything having one charging port is a benefit but there's still the issue of the power supply being appropriate for the device and the stupid cables that do both or either charging and data transfer.  

As far as the progress of technology is concerned, this sounds like an incredibly shortsighted and self-serving law that seems to prohibit innovation. Are we now stuck with USB-C forever?  

And what happens if Apple doesn't adopt a USB-C port this year? The mandate doesn't start until 2024 so there's no pressure to do so now. I can't imagine the backlash against Apple for not doing what it's been speculated they will do. Whether or not they *should* do it is irrelevant (they should).

USB-C is so new that I had lightning cables well before USB-C and I don’t understand why have two types of cables (presumably 1 or 2 each) is such a big deal? If you had 40 all jumbled in the same box half of USB-C and half lightning, then sure. But that’s an organization problem.

What I want to happen: I can get all sorts of apps that were previously not allowed on Apple's app store. That is definitely useful.

What I don't what to happen: A bunch of apps I currently use removing themselves from the App store and go exclusive to third party app stores. For example, having to download a Facebook store for Instagram, a Netflix store for the Netflix app, a Weather Channel store for the Weather Channel, etc.

The argument I usually hear is that this hasn't happened on Android so it won't happen on iOS. I hope you are right. My fear is that since most of the money is made in the App Store, then when Apple allows it the floodgates will open. Even if Apple were to give away their hosting services on the App Store for free for developers, I imagine it is possible the analytics/data scraping a developer can do getting a third party app store on your device could outweigh the benefits of remaining on the official App Store.

10qvc9c,Joe Biden wants Apple to free your iPhone from App Store lockdown,"I’m torn in this, Apple is a private sector company and should be free to do what it pleases with its products, don’t like it don’t buy it….

Then the free market/customer side of me thinks that Apple should open it up and let users do what they want with the phone they paid for.

Then the security part of me realizes that in a closed ecosystem that they have full control over what is and isn’t on the phone thus increasing security.(well aware it can be jailbroken but for normal users that’s not a thing)

Idk…at the end of the day all I want is for my phone to be secure, not worried that much about other things and having my iPhone in a closed ecosystem is fine, sure others disagree and I can see that POV but it’s important to understand this isn’t a clear cut issue and there are good and bad things no matter what path Apple goes or is forced to go.

While some think this is just about Apple having control over its store and protecting its profits I tend to disagree not that it couldn’t be true to some extent, just think life is easier when you can have some control over your platform and what goes on it.

10qvc9c,Joe Biden wants Apple to free your iPhone from App Store lockdown,"This all 100% makes sense in the context of mobile phones. Absolutely no reason the maker of the device should be able to decide what I use my devices for, and arbitrary limitations on where apps can be installed from only exists to make everyone pay apple 30% of their revenue.

We wouldn't let Microsoft make all PC programs only able to be downloaded and installed from the microsoft store, and all program purchases must be made through microsoft's payment system where they get a 30% cut, and it equally doesn't make sense for phones.

&#x200B;

The interesting thing is if this would apply to all devices, including Game Consoles. If it did, Nintendo for example would legally have to allow consumers to use alternate web browsers, install homebrew apps, set up alternate operating systems on their Switch/other consoles, and just in general let people do whatever they want with their device WITHOUT legally being able to brick their device or ban them from their online services just because they have non Nintendo-approved stuff on their system.

I think in general if I buy something I as the owner should be able to do whatever the hell I want with my device and the maker should not be able to decide ""well if you do some of these things with your device, I'm gunna make all my software not work"". I bought the device AND the software installed on it, and just like computer makers aren't legally allowed to void my warranty or brick my computer for swapping out a harddrive or installing some new ram or deleting some garbage apps they included on the machine, it shouldn't be legal for software to be disabled in a similar fashion if other software they didn't make is installed on the device.",GStarG,16,1675277371.0

Yes I agree they should pay developers better, and that there is room for improvement but I don’t want my AppStore to have the same problem the rest of of the tech industry seems to be in right now. For example having all the different social media’s because certain people only use certain ones. Having Netflix and Amazon prime, and all the others because I want to be able to watch all the shows I want and sometimes I can’t get them just in one place. When I play games on my PC I have 7+ launchers because the games are all split up. For emails I have 3 apps because different companies use different services. When I listen to music I need Spotify and apple music and sometimes Amazon. When I listen to podcasts it’s the same deal. 

My point being. That as soon as you add competitors to the App Store you’ll eventually have to download whichever the new one is when an app you use currently decides it no longer wants to be on the Apple App Store and is now only available on Google App Store or whatever else.",None,2,1675280837.0

10qvc9c,Joe Biden wants Apple to free your iPhone from App Store lockdown,"I’ve worked in mobile development off and on for years. I’m super conflicted about calls like this.

The first part is that the current situation is fucked, and needs reform. Apple’s mismanagement of the App Store is a running joke in the industry. But all things being equal, Apple’s situation is orders of magnitude better than the competitors - Google has basically abandoned the playing field, letting their store fall into the abyss. Apple being the “best” is not an endorsement of Apple - it’s an indictment of all the others. You can be the king of the shit box, but it’s still a shit box.

All of that being said, App Stores are natural monopolies, and I don’t think it’s an area where “competition” actually solves much. If anything. And actually opens up a Pandora’s box of potential problems that are far, far bigger than the market currently suffers from.

I think what you do instead is actually behave like a functional government and implement some regulations around app stores. Implement a framework around content moderation, around app acceptance/rejection policies, around pricing structures.",deVliegendeTexan,2,1675323256.0

114mbfa,Lobbyist working for Apple and others managed to rewrite NY Right to Repair law.,"“Of, by, and for” the people broke down when corporations became people and Congress didn’t define corporate personhood. Unelected people (SCOTUS) have for over a century given corporations the same rights and speech as people - these amorphous, immortal entities that can’t go to prison have many of the same rights you and I do. Sure, they can’t vote… but they lobby. Hard. And they have no brain of their own. 

Corporations need to be constitutionally defined and their separate rights, obligations, and limits to their rights called out. The board / majority owners and executives need to be explicitly given responsibility for certain kinds of wrongdoing. From the opioid epidemic to the frequent hazmat train derailments to the 2007/8 financial crisis, Wells Fargo defrauding customers with fake accounts, it’s insane nobody goes to prison, let alone jailed, over causing those things. Namely, I would abolish the right of free speech for corporations and define PACs and any other sources of “dark money” as corporations - individuals speak out, use your own money and face to try and buy a politician. 

The bill of rights for people need to be updated. Namely, a right to privacy needs to be spelled out - not just to unreasonable search from government but. Right to reasonable privacy from corporations (the biggest data collectors today) and individuals need to be defined. It’s gross our data is sold many times over each day without knowledge or consent or oversight. A right to education exists in practice but needs to be in the constitution too - we all know with the recent SCOTUS decision how practical rights are reversible. Trickier to enforce rights - a healthy environment, access to utilities, etc. can be defined.

Finally, and I can’t stress this enough, we need to stop pretending corporations can be trusted with infrastructure. PG&E caused multiple humongous fireS. Rail companies cause derailments. They buy back stock and increase dividends instead of maintaining infrastructure. Public infrastructure lowers the barriers to entry for competition. Easier said than done (accurate metering of usage could be tough for certain services), but it can’t be allowed to stand that “deferred maintenance” in the name of profit causes some of the biggest man made disasters of the day. The tax to update infrastructure should go directly on the companies that use it. And if they can’t lobby, then it may actually work. 

How ridiculous is it our government gave billions of dollars to deploy fiber internet nationwide and it just didn’t happen (they said dsl is high speed internet, we meet the requirements) and nobody is in prison and they just got to keep the money? If the government stood up fiber themselves it couldn’t have gone down that way. It’s insane to have so many cell towers from individual companies instead of, you know, a cell tower network that multiple companies pay to use (see Europe). Yeah, you eliminate competition on coverage… but everyone gets coverage everywhere and you’re not at the whim of a profit decision for what’s become a wireless utility. As far as priorities, life and safety + national security infrastructure needs to be maintained by the government. Should be the next priority. Then utility infrastructure that’s not life and safety (counting internet and mobile access as modern utilities; these are not currently utilities). Everything else is fine the way it is.

You’d think what I’m proposing is all far fetched. And it is. Not because it wouldn’t work but because we are here, and we are a government of the immortal corporation, by the immortal corporation, for the rich people. I’ll die in maybe 50 years if I’m lucky and none of it will have happened, but indentured servitude may make a comeback the way we’re going with inequality.",Free_Dimension1459,6,1676724962.0

It causes tremendous damage to innovation long-term while also generally causing extra costs of implementation in the short term.

Right now, I bring a 3-in-1 charging cable with me everywhere. This is slightly inefficient compared to if I just had to bring a USB-C cable.

However. If everyone everywhere only have the same cables, it becomes extra hard to try to bring a new potentially better charging cable to market.

If 1% of users in the world already have different cable needs, it means there is a userbase for a new better charging cable - and so a new product line can take off. If it is better than the existing cables, it can eventually get added to new '3-in-1 charging cables', and then more people will have it - and eventually it may kill off the USB-C. New product lines may not be better for everyone everywhere, they could just be better for some purposes - and then as they're improved on further - they suddenly come to be overall better.

16jg6dw,iPhone 15 Models Have 'Completely Standard' USB-C Port Without Restrictions on Accessories,"Remember apple's ""accessory protocol"" from 20 years ago? Pepperidge Farms remembers.

Since chargers don't send data, the data pins on the USB connector are usually left unconnected. At the time, apple made their devices check those data pins anyway, looking for a certain resistance value before charging. No resistance on the data pins? No charging.

This was all apple had to do to get their customers to only buy apple or apple-licensed chargers. It worked for a few years until other manufacturers started catching on and apple switched to their MFI authorization chips.

Never underestimate apple's willingness to meddle with simple things we take for granted (I mean, a charger is just a charger, right?) just to trap their users into buying their expensive accessories.

EDIT: People seem to be ignoring the ""20 years ago"" at the top of the post. My comment is to illustrate that this sort of thing is part of apple's DNA and business strategy.

The ""accessory protocol"" lasted a few years and was replaced by the MFI program. It affected devices, from my experience, like the iPod Minis and 4th gen iPods (I couldn't say if it applied to HP-branded iPods of the time). Apparently, it was used in early iPhones, though I couldn't tell you from firsthand experience.

For a more thorough explanation, the lovely people at adafruit (not an endorsement, just a fan) published [this article and video](https://learn.adafruit.com/minty-boost/icharging) at the time about and reverse engineering it so a common charger would power an apple device of the time.",Metahec,737,1694796313.0

On July 1st, 2023, Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed. This move will require developers of third-party
applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications (which include
browsers like Reddit Is Fun, moderation tools like Pushshift, and accessibility-focused add-ons for users who are visually
impaired) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable
than it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.

Reddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on
uncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact 
both groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; 
without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting 
creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an 
ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit – the fixtures which make it
appealing – will be eliminated.

We implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has
allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not
tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no 
thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman's statement – ""I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our
shareholders to be users"" – is to be taken seriously, then please consider this our vote:

Allow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access.

Allow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.

15cxwaa,Apple Pencils can’t draw straight on third-party replacement iPad screens,"I know it’s an easy conclusion but it logically does not make sense. 

Think about how Apple DRM's its parts and how the user experiences that form of silly DRM.  

It’s always through messaging and disabled functionality. This is not that. 
This is a telltale sign of digitizer lacking proper calibration or missing calibration altogether. 

An easy and just as plausible scenario is: The old chip has calibration values (from the old screen). 

The new chip is possibly identical but has no calibration values at all. When swapped with the old chip it performs better because the calibration values from the old screen exist. Through margins of error being relatively low in mass production - not zero - you’ll see straight lines that may still not be perfect but better compared to no calibration whatsoever. 

Apple are easy to hate, but this report is likely an overly exaggerated take. It’s a good story and obviously generates clicks. 

So it's not malicious, just not designed for repair. Hanlon's razor applies here somewhat.",fcmyk,3,1690735347.0

15cxwaa,Apple Pencils can’t draw straight on third-party replacement iPad screens,"In the end what is happening here is the SN of the display does not match the calibration info stored on the SOC so the system runs without any calibration.   


When you switch the controle chip to the new display then the SN matches so it uses the old calibration, and most of the sensors are very smilier so using the old calibration means you get a much better result than using no calibration.    


I suppose apple could (maybe should) offer 2 things:  


1) Option to use a calibration profile even if the SN does not match  
2) Allow the device to download the correct profile form apples servers even if apple do not approve the agreeing of SOC and display. (perhaps with the limitation that this is not possible if the display was paired to a device now reported as stolen or iCloud locked)  


Apple a few years ago moved to putting all calibration info for sensors cloud side and having the diagnostic mode download this from apples servers when the server agrees on the pairing of SN to SOC.    


This change was likly a cost saving measure to simplify the production calibration stage, instead of needing to have an extra station in the factory to write the calibration info to the display controler chip they can skip this by just reading the SN and saving the profile in the cloud.  It also might let them have much smaller/cheaper little controler state chips as they only need to store a SN not an entire profile.  one display SN can then be used for color profile, touch, pencil profiles.",hishnash,5,1690670482.0

As other people metioned here, Android phones still receive updates to apps even almost 10 years later including security, only the OS update (which often includes comparatively minor features) is at some point dropped. That's because Apple and Google have two different ways of updating their phones so the comparison is meaningless. 

It'd also like to add that the Pixel 4a was $350 at launch when the XR STARTED at $750. Even if the article were to make a fair point with the updating and security, the two phones are totally different in terms of price and expectations so again, bad article.

Literally the only reason to use a pixel these days is because of the camera; hardware and software. No other Android phone maker is in the same universe as google when it comes to camera and photos. The rest is just updates, and pixels are popular enough to have lineage support for years and years. 

You can patch root to bypass all the safetynet bs too, so there's literally no reason not to use lineage anymore. You can install the google camera app, have literally everything Pixel phones have, with more freedom.

But then google, with the 6 and 7 series phones, made their own SOC design and owns all of the components--meaning they can produce valid signed drivers for however long they want to support the phone via software updates.  But look what happened--the pixel 6 launched and it had an abysmal 3 years of Android OS updates and only an additional 2 years beyond that with security updates.

I kept getting an alert about an air tag near me. I pulled over in a grocery store in east Boston at like midnight (shout out to the stop n shop) and I flipped this car inside out out for about an hour and found an air tag tucked way under the passenger seat. Turns out it was unregistered and I was able to take it and then register it to my phone and now I have an airtag.

Messengers are superior, and they could easily be made interoperable. But Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta and all the little ones like Signal, Threema and Telegram would have to open their ecosystems. Which they will jump through a of hoops not to have to do.

For those who don’t know, NAT stands for Network Address translation. It was created to as a stopgap solution to solve the issue of insufficient IP addresses long enough for IPv6 to be created and implemented. Around 2004, it was discovered that the world was running out of IP addresses. So, NAT was born. NAT works by mapping internal IP addresses to a single external IP address.

179wp34,"Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max users are reporting cases of OLED burn-in | First the overheating problems, now this","How though... modern OLED’s should NOT be having burn-in like this. It should take thousands of hours at high brightness, on the exact same screen, before you’d even begin to see slight a amount of burn-in.

There’s a YouTuber who’s name I can’t remember right now who has had a Switch OLED on max brightness and paused on the same screen the entire time  24/7 for like 2 years non-stop with very little burn-in as a result. 

I’m not against the thought of this being fake news at this point to try and bash the new iPhone even more than it’s been.

TL;DR - People, it generally takes THOUSANDS of hours to cause burn-in on modern OLED’s. This isn’t normal, and is almost certainly not going to happen to every iPhone 15. This is NOT something that happens from leaving your phone on the same screen at night like someone commented.",DarthAK47,22,1697559202.0

OLED panels usually come with a pixel refresh or panel compensation cycle that runs when the TV is off that lasts like 10 minutes and a big one that lasts about an hour every 2000+ hours.    
     
It helps clear up issues like this that look like burn in.    
     
The confusing part is Burn In is when the OLED pixels are so degraded that the panel can no longer fix it by running that compensation cycle.

On July 1st, 2023, Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed. This move will require developers of third-party
applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications (which include
browsers like Reddit Is Fun, moderation tools like Pushshift, and accessibility-focused add-ons for users who are visually
impaired) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable
than it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.

Reddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on
uncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact 
both groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; 
without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting 
creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an 
ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit – the fixtures which make it
appealing – will be eliminated.

We implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has
allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not
tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no 
thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman's statement – ""I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our
shareholders to be users"" – is to be taken seriously, then please consider this our vote:

Allow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access.

Allow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.

15k11fg,Repairability vs reliability: Apple argues that removable batteries add a potential failure point to phones,"So many people here aren't reading the article. Apple is talking out of its ass, as per usual. They just don't want users to be able to replace their batteries fairly easily because they want to encourage users to replace their devices instead of keeping them.

Here's what the EU said ""user replaceable"" means:

>“A portable battery should be considered to be removable by the end-user when it can be removed with the use of commercially available tools and without requiring the use of specialised tools, unless they are provided free of charge, or proprietary tools, thermal energy or solvents to disassemble it.”

[https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/24/23771064/european-union-battery-regulation-ecodesign-user-replacable-batteries](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/24/23771064/european-union-battery-regulation-ecodesign-user-replacable-batteries)

&#x200B;

So you can still have the back panel be screwed on. You can still glue down the battery. ~~You just can't use those proprietary pentalobe screws that Apple uses purely to fuck users~~ (pentalobe screws are not prorietary, they are just uncommon security screws) and they can't put the battery in an impossible to reach place where you have to take three quarters of the phone apart to get to it.

None of this is unreasonable. It has been done before on plenty of devices and you can get devices currently that are waterproof ánd have user replaceable batteries like the Samsung XCover 6 Pro. And that's a phone with a back cover that pops off, which isn't required by the EU.

If you do feel this is unreasonable, you must not think very highly of Apple.

I don't like Apple's business practices much, but there's no denying they know how to engineer stuff. There's the Face ID technology, the LiDAR technology on the Pro model iPhones, the haptic touch tech and most recently the Vision Pro headset.

15k11fg,Repairability vs reliability: Apple argues that removable batteries add a potential failure point to phones,"Yeah, no. I have apple repair certifications and this is complete nonsense. In terms of overall repair volume not caused explicitly by impact, batteries are the most numerous because they're designed to be. As others have stated, Lithium ion batteries degrade very rapidly triggering the phones service warning at approximately 80% maximum capacity which on average takes about 2-3 years. Warranty and apple care+ coverage most commonly maxes at 2 years. That's not coincidence. Battery repairs cost 90 dollars for the client but only cost the repair location about 40 after shipping. It's not the largest margin of profit but is the most likely to happen to every iPhone owner, even the careful ones. ""I'd rather spend 90 dollars and keep my phone for another year or 2 than have to upgrade right this second since the new model comes out in a couple months""

As for the details of battery repairs as ""fail points"", it's 2 plugs and some sticky tape. That's it. The battery sits on a little spot over the mag safe ring (which is for space optimization because it used to just sit in a blank space for mag safe), has 2 or 3 strips of a sticky adhesive strip holding it to the chassis of the phone. And then 2 ribbon cables plug in over the top of each other. Users aren't going to find a way to sever those cables or damage the battery by accident. The glass will break first voiding the ability to get your battery repaired anyway (if there's physical damage present compounding with a second reported issue, the entire unit must be replaced by apples protocol). 

For water damage, I mean I guess kind of but the main fail points for liquid damage is through the charging port and speakers which are closer in proximity to the logic board than the battery connectors. The connectors are close to the ear piece speaker/front cameras so they have 1/3 entry points but the other 2 are on the opposite end of the phone. Which makes the display connectors closer to those 2 as well meaning the display ports are more likely to be damaged by liquid than the battery. 

I will say the safety increase in not having to change batteries is a singular positive. Those adhesive strips are so fragile that during the removal process, they are liable to break and need to be ""retrieved"" which is basically trying to reach under the battery with tweezers to grab the strip again. When this happens, the battery bending or if the coating on the battery is pierced, the battery can undergo a thermal event which is technical talk for it catching on fire. Or at the very least, venting hazardous gases into the face of the repair guy. I'd appreciate not having to worry about battery repairs anymore but not when the implications are intentionally butchering the idea of right to repair. As well as very obvious cost increases upfront and when apple charges you a whole unit replacement for a repair 2 weeks out of warranty for their battery suddenly not lasting as long as it did only a few days ago",SchuyWalker,14,1691359320.0

15k11fg,Repairability vs reliability: Apple argues that removable batteries add a potential failure point to phones,"The only time I’ve had issues with iPhone batteries is when an update affects the battery life (like what happened with previous generations).  My iPhone 4s had a noticeable battery life drop after an update when it was about 4 years old.  That was something Apple obviously did and were rightfully condemned for it.

I buy a new phone every 4-6 years, and it’s more based on the hardware becoming less optimal than battery not lasting as long.  I also use my phone a lot (constant phone calls/texts and videos playing in between while doing paperwork).  Currently have an iPhone 11 and I rarely ever have to charge before I go to sleep.  It’s nearly 4 years old and battery life isn’t an issue for me (been on it today nearly nonstop for 6 hours and battery is at 80%).

For me, the battery life is acceptable, especially compared to earlier generations.  The hardware becomes “obsolete” (less optimized for new iOS versions) before the battery life decays too far.  Maybe I’m in the minority, but I prefer the water resistance in a thin design over easy battery replacement.  

I also remember my old non-smartphones “exploding” into pieces if they were dropped.  Those phones had horrible battery life by comparison, and despite being able to replace the battery easily, it was extremely rare for someone to actually swap batteries for a charged one.  Those batteries also wouldn’t have near the lifespan either.

I’ve seen the “support” for over two decades on laptops.

Companies will make battery packs with proprietary shapes and connectors so you can’t just buy any.

They’ll sell the specific battery pack for your phone for maybe two years and then you have to reply on a sketchy Chinese brand from Amazon.

Companies like Dell will charge $500-600 for a replacement battery pack because they are no longer being manufactured.

This law is bad without additional stipulations and standards on internal connectors, shapes, materials, etc..

So I’d rather have my $80 battery replacement with apple than getting ripped off like they currently do for laptops and other devices.

Edit: I support right to repair law but this is different from that.

impaired) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable
than it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.

Reddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on
uncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact 
both groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; 
without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting 
creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an 
ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit – the fixtures which make it
appealing – will be eliminated.

We implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has
allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not
tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no 
thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman's statement – ""I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our
shareholders to be users"" – is to be taken seriously, then please consider this our vote:

Allow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access.

Allow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.

16yr0fp,iPhone 15 users report BMW's wireless phone charger kills its NFC chip,"It's likely a problem with two wrongs making a bigger wrong. Apple clearly have ended up creating a phone that runs hotter than their previous devices and BMW's charging pads are prone to running hotter themselves. Combined, it's just match made in hell.

I got frustrated with the wireless charging pad in my BMW iX because of how slow it was at charging and at how prone it was to cutting off due to overheating. If I charged my iPhone 14 Pro on there, I'd commonly get a message on the car's display saying something along the lines of ""wireless charging halted due to overheating"" and it would then have to wait to cool down. I found that the best the wireless charging pad could do was maintaining battery level rather than provide additional charging and even that was sometimes a stretch. It didn't help that you had to perfectly position your phone on the pad and wait for the screen to say charging had started, which meant it wasn't a simple throw-your-phone-down action.

I ended up 3d printing a mount that slots into the existing phone holder in the car and lets me use a standard Apple MagSafe charger ([this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5864089/files) although I shaved down the top end a bit to better fit my phone case). It works absolutely perfectly. It looks pretty seamless in the car, means you can see the display while driving, if you wanted to and charges so much faster.

Apple should have done some more QC on their phones for 3rd party wireless charging solutions but BMW shouldn't have released cars with garbage charging pads. For the amount either of the products cost, it's not really acceptable.",Spanky2k,55,1696342350.0

15qjvwx,"iPhone 14, 14 Pro owners complain about battery capacity that’s already falling off","I get really frustrated with public conversations about battery health because people so confidently assert gigantic assumptions. People talk about leaving your phone charged overnight or charging it all the way to 100% or using wireless charging. Or even apples really slow so-called fast charging....


I doubt any of those are the primary culprits. That stuff has been happening for years, especially on the Android side where people are charging stuff at 100 watts on Chinese phones. One plus has been doing 65 Watts for generations and there's been no noticeable complaints or anecdotes there about battery life duration of health..


I think it's probably more to do with the chip in the iPhone 14s which is basically an overclocked a 15 or 16 or whatever which was in the previous phone.

iPhone 13 got better battery life and I think they overclock to the chip for the next generation and it's just less efficient.

That's still a theory though I'm not saying that with a whole lot of confidence. But I just lose my mind when people try to compare these batteries to like car batteries from 197o.

These phones are smart enough to stop taking a charge when it gets to 100%. And only charging your phone up to 80% is to suffer a 20% drop in battery capacity.... Basically the fate you're trying to avoid the whole time.


I use more than one phone so it's probably not an apples to apples comparison but my phones will use up about 2 to 6% of its battery health each year. My v60 It's still at like 95 or 6% battery health after 2 years. Pixel 4a is on 88% after 3 years.

I imagine the vast majority of users will not need a lightning to usb-c adapter. Also he says for the very best you will need the thunderbolt 4 cable which again is a cable for connecting high bandwidth devices to Mac desktops and is not something anyone needs for an iPhone. Even the iPhone pro doesn’t support thunderbolt 4. And it’s speeds will top out with a normal usb-c cable. 99% of users will get an iPhone with a usb-c cable in the box and never need another dongle or cable again.

Out of the gates, the author is a bozo. For years now there has been zero reason to upgrade to the next incremental model of technology. Glad they played their cards early to sidestep the article. Being a ""techie"" doesn't excuse excessive waste and general indulgence.

Anyone paying attention to tech is well aware of the small steps in technology these days. I went from an XR to 15 only because the XR was really limping along.

I’ve seen it mentioned in comments about the new iPhones and pixels the last 2 or so years - we’ve essentially hit a plateau. New phones are better but nothing like the yearly changes we got for the first decade of smartphones. I’d like to hear a tech writers thoughts on that vs us random bozos on Reddit 

For the first decade I had iPhones and android phones, I repeatedly ran into issues with not being able to run new software after a year or so. I’ve yet to have that issue with my 12 pro. Still not sure if that or the battery losing capacity will be my main reason to upgrade. 

> Now, let’s think about it. For most of us, the iPhone 13 in late 2023 wouldn’t be that great.

Legit want to know what this guy does on his phone that a 13 isn’t that great. Camera and battery are the two big ones for me.

10yrkon,Apple Reportedly Planning to Limit iPhone 15's USB-C Port in the Same Way as Lightning.,"This is speculative but it's not unreasonable speculation because it's based on a real technical limitation.

The Apple A series chips started life out as mobile chips. The good part of that is the incredible efficiency. The bad part is heavily limited bandwidth due to just a few PCIe lanes. The M1 has more and can support one Thunderbolt/USB 4.0, but it wasn't until the M1 Pro/Max were released that the chips had enough PCIe lanes for it to be compared to a real AMD/Intel desktop chip.

If this comes to fruition, it's going to be because they didn't invest any money/effort in expanding PCIe on the A17 chip design, not because of some ""screw you"" arbitrary limitation.

As for the MFi stuff, it's fine. You aren't gated from using non-MFi lightning cables in any way unless your iPhone is company managed and they choose to not let you use it. For personal use, you just get a warning. It's no different than the warning you get when you try to run unsigned binaries on any Mac or Windows OS. You can even suppress the warning if you want. Having data cables signed is a good thing. These days all of the hardware and software you use are signed. The websites you browse are signed. MFi closes a very real and often exploited attack vector. Just like with HTTP-only and unsigned binaries, you aren't limited to only using MFi, but you have to intentionally authorize it.",unskilledplay,5,1676060147.0

USB 2.0 speed limitations do not belong on any new, modern device in 2023, much less on the cutting-edge series of iPhones.

16whvgo,Apple will issue a software update to address iPhone 15 overheating complaints,"It’s amazing how many in this thread have noooo idea how tech works and are just resorting to blind hate:

- I mean I’m bias as an former app dev but it 100% makes sense that a background thread could cause overheating. I mean go to the App Store -> find some sketchy looking video editing app -> notice your phone battery draining faster / getting hotter. A solo dev a lot of times can’t be as efficient in their multiprocessing threads vs for example a company like Abobe who can have many devs work on efficient processes / benchmarking / instrumenting to introduce best practices 
- Someone on the comments mentioned indexing photos or other search capabilities (like when you have autocomplete for your messages - only needs to do the mass indexing once) something of the sort. Doing this and not dialing it back when you’re using other intense apps could make sense 

Moral: A lot of these launches have bugs at first. It’s just like the game industry patching after release. And yes Android has a lot of shit bugs too sometimes. This is just how tech companies work now a days. Was it impressive how hardware worldwide launches back in the day wouldn’t have any major bugs, Yes, but this is a different time, companies don’t need to spend as many cycles on that part of the flow now (I’d argue for the better)",funkoscope,12,1696134987.0

16n78n9,iPhone 15 Models Feature New Setting to Prevent Charging Beyond 80%,"In my experience with batteries with all my devices and with my DIY solar off-grid is that the 100% rule as ""bad"" is highly overrated. It's basically negligible on single battery lithium systems in fact I only considered not doing it when I'm dealing with old multi-battery lithium system when 1 battery is weaker than the others.

In my experience, the main culprit for battery degradation is battery's exposure to extended high temperatures while being charged and more so while being discharged. 

Let me tell you that I have encountered many people that are very battery conscious, to the point paranoid, about their battery getting charged to 100% so they charge only to 80 - 90% while they themselves were the main contributor to their battery health degradation by gaming and exposing their battery to very high temps for hours while being discharged more than usual.

Discharging at high temps contributes more battery degradation than charging to 100%.

I still charge all my devices to 100% overnight with no problems for years. IDK why people are getting paranoid about charging to 100% for fuck's sake, your battery is already managed by a BMS, why are you even trying to micromanage a BMS.",ggezboye,17,1695177171.0

Tbh it works really well I haven't seen any battery degradation since i bought them.

For people confused about why I'd choose this lemme explain.
Most the time I'm indoors with easy access to a charger, so charging up to 100% and harming my battery would be pointless. Hell my laptop stays inside 95% of the time it's basically a desktop replacement that I can move of I need to so is permanently plugged in.
But if i do need to take my laptop somewhere or am going on a long trip where I won't be able to charge my phone I disable the feature, let them charge till full and enjoy the full day one battery life.

Without this feature I'd have a permanently degraded battery without the ability to boost battery life all for the sake of charging to 100% when I didn't need to so now I can't when I do need to.

You rarely ever need 100% charge but of you let your phone charge that high on a day to day basis then you won't have a true 100% when you really need it.
Even with replaceable batteries it still makes sense to improve battery life and reduce e-waste.

This means no LTE and no carrier service contracts. they sell the iPad Pro with an M2 processor starting at $799. My guess is they'll start around $999, if they actually escape the design lab. Apple wants that service revenue. 

As far as ""killer apps"", some kind of VR Facetime doesn't make any sense, because having your face covered by a set of goggles is no longer Facetime. Memojis are fun but not exactly better than your actual face. It would be easy for them to build realtime photorealistic memojis by scanning your face with your iPhone, but that might be even weirder.

Other than games and media (live concerts? spatial audio?), the best I can come up with is remote education/learning (where it's mostly one way), but that would have been the killer app during the pandemic. Not anymore. 

I'd love to not have to necessarily be on camera during a remote work meeting, but unless everyone is wearing goggles it's not going to fly as a replacement.

* I may not love Android or Google, I may wish just one major player would embrace something like Linux as an OS, but overall I'm happier with my Android+Linux PC+Windows-on-occasion environment. 
* I don't have the money to pay that much for a phone anymore and see no big need to do it. 

I'm ""get off my lawn"" old enough that I don't give 2 licks what color my text messages appear on *your* iPhone. Get over that BS now. 

If Apple were to stop enforcing walled gardens so much and invest in ""phone only"" users in a way that enabled iPhone use with similar-to-OSX features but on a PC, I might look at iPhones, but only if 3rd party app sources were enabled.

16etm92,Apple retail staff drilled to recommend iPhone 15 USB-C charging accessories at point of sale,"Does a charging block with a female USB-C output port (and used with a USB-C-to-USB-C cable) have any performance advantage over a similar charger with USB-A output port (and A-to-C cable)?

Cos I'm unclear why I'm seeing USB-A charging blocks being replaced by C-only, and annoyed that my existing cables are being made obsolete.

* During the last 2 decades, USB-A has been the standard female output port on charging blocks, no matter whether the USB cable being inserted into it is connected at its other end to a device featuring a USB-mini, USB-micro, USB-C, or Lightning port.

* Consumers were fed up with having to have multiple different USB cables and/or fixed-wire chargers (particularly in the case of Apple, as their devices featured proprietary Lightning ports). Not only was it inconvenient to have to remember which wire went with which device and to bring each type with you when you left the house, but it was added cost and waste of natural resources (1 wire that could do them all is better than having to own 2, 3 or 4 types).

* The EU mandated that ""By the end of 2024, all mobile phones, tablets and cameras sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C charging port.""

* In 2023, in apparent response to the EU mandate, many new charging plugs being released to market have done away with USB-A and instead feature one or more USB-C ports. Existing USB-A-to-whatever cables are incompatible with these plugs so consumers will need to buy USB-C-to-USB-C cables for use with newer devices as well as to buy new USB-C-to-whatever cables for using with older devices.

Or, they can continue to do what they've always done, and carry around multiple charging blocks and/or wires.",DanielB_CANADA,2,1694362931.0

M1 development, and all other R&D costs, has already been amortized through the previous generation Macbooks.  So, it's just cost to produce, which ranges from [$250-$350](https://www.newzealandrabbitclub.net/how-much-does-it-cost-apple-to-make-a-macbook-air-m1/) as the driving factor for price.  

I can see Apple pricing it near cost, placing a clamped down OS on it that limits what it can do, not sell to the general public (and thus don't reveal their pricing), and make money on the educational software as they get educational institutions to go through their ecosystem.  Similar to a razor and blade model.

16bjc28,Apple's answer to Chromebooks? Rumors point to low-cost MacBooks for 2024 | What's Apple's definition of low-cost?,"People say this all the time about laptops and manufacturers but it's because I feel like no one really gets what a chromebook is. I have a PC at home to do PC things, and an iPhone for phone things. The Chromebook (which I'm typing on now) is literally for the convenience of having the internet hooked up to a keyboard and mouse that I can take with me and runs and opens pretty quick. I can access the internet with it and do a bunch of stuff on the internet with it, but ultimately it's all it is. I keep it with when gaming on my PS5 or Switch so I can browse the web. I use it when I'm going to the bathroom and don't want to use my crappy phone keyboard to type. 

It's a compact little 10inch device that I use for just utility web browsing. It is not a laptop. It's got a simple, fairly well protected OS. If something does get through, say a virus, or whatever, I can wipe it and have it running again in seconds. A Streambook or a lowcost Macbook is still going to just be a laptop. If I want a laptop for actual use like gaming and work, I'd get a laptop and I'd want a fairly niceish one. For just something to have on me that works, is connected to the internet, and is fast and secure, I'm using a Chromebook. If they can't provide that, they're not really competing with a Chromebook, they're just making a cheap laptop that'll still have laptop use and laptop problems. 

**TL;DR: The Chromebook is the Switch of the laptop world.**

Question I have is: does it need to be that powerful?

The 13-inch MBA M1 now costs 999$, M2 variant is 1099$. The Apple Silicon chips are absolutely amazing, so I would love it if Apple kept making the M1 MBA past M2, M3, M4, M5, maybe even M6. Since most people who buy the MBA are simply looking for a small, thin, cheap laptop they can write some emails on, pay some bills, watch Netflix, YouTube, maybe some light schoolwork. They don’t need a top of the line chip, and by that point they could drop the price quite low to maybe even compete around the 600USD mark.

having a lower cost device would need to make sacrifices on components, performance, or build quality. apple strictly maintains their products to have high quality in all these aspects, so if they can do this at a lower price, then why would people purchase the more expensive ones? 

furthermore, if someone's first experience with the apple brand is a cheap, plastic case device of yesteryear, they may get a lower impression of the apple brand as a whole. 
Samsung already has this effect from their cheaper devices. 
People view their entire phone lineup based on their impressions with cheap devices.

Chromebooks are fucking expensive when you consider lifetime value.

To be used in most schools, Chromebooks need to maintain a current version of software. Currently, it appears that all or almost all Chromebooks expire after 4 years. Most Chromebooks for sale will hit the schools with less than three or even two years of viable use because of the lengthy sales cycle.

So instead of $200-400.00 for each Chromebook, it’s really $200-400 for every Chromebook *every two or three years*

So Apple doesn’t need to compete with that Lowe price, they just need to provide a computer that lasts for a longer period of time so that the cost, when amortized, come out to be less than the cost of constantly updating old out of update Chromebooks. 

An Apple “edu-book” would be cheap coming in at anywhere near 2-3 times the cost of an average Chromebook because they will (based on historic averages) last much longer than Chromebooks.",foulpudding,1,1694024371.0

Contextual keybinds have always been a thing, and there's an entire keyboard for them. A keyboard that my fingers are already on, that has homing keys, and that has a sensory component that means I can identify the right key location without having to look at it.

A clear and custom generated context bar was a great idea in making shortcuts intuitive and unambiguous, but the execution was just all wrong. No standardisation in button sizes, and a tiny bar that you had to lean in and over the top of the keyboard to actually see. It was hard to use, awkward, and didn't actually save any time over using the keyboard or the mouse as your hands weren't naturally over it anyway.

1. The physical keyboard is not like a touch screen. Each key serves a specific purpose. It worked on mobile because of the constraints it bypassed. Constraints that don’t exist in a laptop. 

2. Accessibility. physical  keys being physically tactile and feelable means you can use them without looking. A huge win for people who can’t see well enough or at all. 

3. It wasn’t broken. Modifier keys can be used to expand the F key functionality, and having to remember a keyboard shortcut is easier than remembering which state the Touch Bar is currently in, how to get it to change to the state you want, and then executing a task with it. 

touch target accuracy, muscle memory, efficiency, basically it had too much “play.” Too much freedom can indeed sometimes be a bad thing, contrary to the official dogma of our society. 

Every mistake Apple (and everyone else for that matter!) makes is an opportunity to learn. The Touch Bar was a big risk and it wasn’t a horrible idea at the core of its conception. I think they could’ve made it a cool and useful interface element if they focused on maintaining the core functionality and adding on top of it, instead of expecting people to learn a whole entire new interface paradigm.

It's an experience you'll remember for years. I've seen it. All of the buzz about how mind blowing the tech is isn't hyperbole. I truly mean this. From what I can tell, this is a universal sentiment among people who have demoed it.

The problem so far is that there isn't a killer use-case for this tech outside of military (who are actively investing billions in this tech) and various professional uses. It's easily one of the coolest things I've ever seen but I couldn't tell you what I would want to do with it.

If it's anywhere close to as good as the Magic Leap tech was 5 years ago, this will blow you away. But why would you buy it?

My speculation is that Apple, like Google (invested heavily in Magic Leap) and Microsoft (HoloLens) before them are running into the same problem. They can't figure out what the consumer market for the tech can or should be.

They will throw it out and see what people can do with it. Of the big three companies in this space, Apple is best positioned to succeed doing this. 

I can't buy that it's being released because Apple doesn't want to eat the loss of billions invested in this - Apple has shown they won't hesitate to scuttle major projects. It's just that this tech is too damn cool to let it fail without putting it out there.",unskilledplay,30,1682037385.0

With phones, the discrepancy really isn't there. There are many people who wouldn't think twice about dropping $3k a year on an iphone with cutting edge tech just like there are lots of people out there buying Corvettes with insane market adjustments on them right now.  Now, a corvette isn't cutting edge nor the best sports car- most of its buyers will never push it to its limits nor do they care.  They have the money and they want it.

The shape closed, still weird, the outside screen, still a bit of a chore to use, but that's a Samsung issue as other producers went with a different form factor. There's two reasons why they're not taking off.

1) It's still treated like a novelty.
2) They price it at a premium when they also offer steep discounts which means it's a cash grab.

Just treat the damn line like another offering in your yearly release cycle and set prices closer to cost and not scalp the user base with the markup. 

Also Samsung, get the damn stylus INSIDE the Fold already. Have you seen the vast majority of case solutions for the pen? They look like the phone has a tumor! Even the official case that houses the pen on the back case wall is an ugly placement.",WordNERD37,7,1704122836.0

I thinks it's as revolutionary as the first iPhone. It hasn't gained as much traction because it's not Apple, it's a foreign tech company and that's always going to make it harder for adoption on a grand scale.

Make no mistake if Apple is smart they got one of their own cooking up and I'll be the first in line to switch back. 

Until then as a tech enthusias this device is amazing and I waited til gen 5 because I didn't want to be an early adopter and pay to beta test, but with the 5 most of the concerns I had are resolved and I can confidently say after 6 months of ownership that the tech is mature enough for prime time

Prior to my Fold I've owned every iPhone except the 4 because that was a trash phone and the first time I switched to Android was that generation with the moto Atrix and HTC One, switched back to Apple with the 5s, I've owned multiple Apple watches, airpod pros, iPads, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro and I gladly sold everything except the MBP after I got the Fold 5 bundle with watch classic and earbuds plus stylus. Side note being able to use the stylus on the phone was one of the biggest reasons I swapped because at 30 years of age, after a decade of smartphone thumb use my hands hurt and a properly working stylus on a phone is something Apple is being incredibly lazy about but that's just how Apple is since Tim Cook passed away. 

Anyways if you're on the fence, do it you won't regret it. At least I haven't and I'm glad I did and I'm as big of an apple enthusiast as it gets, but I'm not a sucker who's just gonna give a company my money out of some weird brand loyalty as they release the same phone for the 5th straight year in a row.

If they could do the same thing with AppleTV and the Mac then all you need is a bunch of displays to show which ever version of the UI you need to at any time.  I hope we get there someday, but Apple has a pretty signficant financial incentive to sell different hardware for each use case.

1) the crease - no matter how minute it is, nobody wants a crease on their screen

2) the cost - the good foldables can cost well over $2000 and foldables are far from offering an experience so far ahead of Candy bars that people are willing to shell out that much.

3) the size - the flip versions don't really offer much above a candy bar phone and the fold versions are so thick when folded that it's annoying to fit in pockets and hold in the hand, plus being heavier

4) the build quality - more moving parts means more things can go wrong in every day use and the hinges are still too intrusive.

Which is a consequence of uncontrolled blood sugar. The problem with silent heart attacks is there are no symptoms. So she went 48 hours, as a result she had a tear in her artery wall. Several months later she is doing well, but is currently function with 35% of her heart function. 

I am assuming the reason why apple is not “going there” is because they don’t want to make promises. When I use my Apple Watch to perform an ecg, it says  something like “Apple Watch doesn’t detect any atrial fib.

Golf clubs have been made with titanium for decades, now.  They can make the non-impact areas super thin, about 4mm tops, but the actual hitting area has to be reinforced.  (eta) I’ve personally dented three titanium drivers and a three wood… it might as well be any other metal at that level of thin.  They have gotten much more expensive, though, so there’s that…

That’s what this is with the iPhone.  You drop it, you’re still at risk to dent it, damage it.  As iamkeiou said, solving a “problem” that doesn’t need solving.  But I bet it helps justify a higher price tag.",jBlairTech,4,1699028910.0

house a battery that lasts more than a day and/or is replaceable.

Apple stopped really being innovators when Jobs passed, and sure, they've had some small, more niche developments as time has progressed. 

Frankly, though, the ecosystem, the amount of money it takes to stay in that ecosystem, and their continued disinterest in form and function that are *actually* really innovative seems to decline with each generation of device.

I think they are just getting sloppy and trying to do a moneygrab in increments, while putting in features that have been standard in other tech for years, and making a big announcement about how it's ""revolutionary"" rofl",Coffee_andBullwinkle,3,1695426287.0

The 24 is a hot mess of power bricks, Ethernet in the power brick, no legacy USB-A ports, no Kensington slot, and WIRELESS peripherals.

11b7wp2,iPhone 15 Pro Launching This Year With These 8 New Features,"A17 chip: iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to be equipped with Apple's A17 Bionic chip manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process, providing continued performance and efficiency improvements. Nikkei Asia claimed that 2023 could mark the second year in a row in which only the Pro models of the new iPhone lineup feature Apple's latest chip.

Titanium frame: Like the Apple Watch Ultra, the frame on iPhone 15 Pro models will be made of titanium instead of stainless steel, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, analyst Jeff Pu, and the leaker known as ""ShrimpApplePro.""

Ultra-thin curved bezels: Similar to recent Apple Watch models, the iPhone 15 Pro will have ultra-thin curved bezels around the display, according to the leaker ""ShrimpApplePro."" The display itself would remain flat.

Faster USB-C port: iPhone 15 Pro models will feature a USB-C port with support for at least USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, which would result in the devices having significantly faster data transfer speeds with a cable compared to existing iPhones with Lightning. Kuo said the USB-C port on standard iPhone 15 models will remain limited to USB 2.0 speeds like Lightning.

Wi-Fi 6E: Like the latest Macs and iPad Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro will support Wi-Fi 6E for faster wireless speeds, according to a leaked schematic.

Increased RAM: iPhone 15 Pro models will be equipped with an increased 8GB of RAM, according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce, while the standard models will likely continue to have 6GB of RAM as they do currently. Additional RAM can allow apps like Safari to keep more content active in the background, preventing the app from reloading content when reopened.

Solid-state buttons: iPhone 15 Pro models will feature solid-state volume and power buttons, according to Kuo. The analyst said the devices will be equipped with two additional Taptic Engines that provide haptic feedback to simulate the feeling of pressing the buttons, without them physically moving, similar to the Home button on the latest iPhone SE or the trackpad on newer MacBooks.

Increased optical zoom for iPhone 15 Pro Max: The iPhone 15 Pro Max will feature a periscope telephoto lens, according to Kuo. This could result in the device having at least 6x optical zoom, compared to 3x on iPhone 14 Pro models.",-6h0st-,90,1677337362.0

I kinda feel like it’d be easier to drum up hype (and in turn, higher sales) if they took the video game console approach to phones. Make a new flagship every handful of years, and then in between release upgraded versions for those who really want something new.

Example: Xbox One, Xbox One S and Xbox One X or whatever it was called. They were all part of the Xbox One line but those two upgraded versions gave die hard fans something new to buy.

But then the Xbox Series X came out after a few years and it was much more of an “event.”

Releasing new phones every single year kinda creates a “shoulder shrug” scenario for most people imo. I don’t think tech should be treated like cars where every year there’s a new model with minimal upgrades.

Spread it out and make the new ones a real event and it would get people so much more excited.",paulrudder,3,1677356325.0

15g7in6,"It is unlikely that the iPhone will end up with an easily replaceable battery, as required by the new EU law. Apple explained its position on this issue","From the article: In an interview with German YouTube channel ORBIT, Apple Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering John Ternus discussed the possibility of using removable batteries in the iPhone. Turnus said he believes that if people need a battery replacement, there should be a safe and effective way to do it.

*There may be a slight conflict between durability and maintainability. You can make an internal component more maintainable by making it discrete and removable, but that actually adds a potential point of failure. Using the data, we can understand which parts of the phone need to be repaired and which parts are actually better made so reliable that they never need to be repaired. It’s always a kind of balance.*

*Our iPhones are IP68 rated, so they’re incredibly water resistant. We always get these great stories when customers tell us how they accidentally dropped their phone in a body of water and it took them two days to get it out and they are so excited because it still works. To get this level of water resistance, there are a lot of high tech adhesives and sealants to make everything waterproof, but of course it makes the opening process a little more difficult. So there is a balance.*

*We take a truly data-driven approach to maintainability. We want to focus on making sure our customers have easy access to repairing things that are most likely to need repair. Last year in iPhone 14, we redesigned the entire phone, making it with a so-called “Mid-Body Architecture” so that the back glass can be detached, making it much easier to repair if someone breaks the back glass.*",chrisdh79,3,1690979106.0
15g7in6,"It is unlikely that the iPhone will end up with an easily replaceable battery, as required by the new EU law. Apple explained its position on this issue","TL;DR version

* Apple isn’t the only company who will do this, I.e., Samsung
* The current law specifies that it’s has to be replaceable via tools, either common around home, commercially available, or tools provided by manufacturers free of charge 
* Apple already does this; just not the free part yet which is a simple fix 
* Law is geared toward cheap phones that aren’t worth replacing battery and are designed to be thrown away
* Media only tells part of the story to rile up people not willing to look deeper

Interesting. Let me start by saying I use both iOS and android phones and devices. It appears that the people commenting “fuck Apple” and other similar verbiage didn’t read through the law for themselves and instead skimmed through an article or 2 that doesn’t go into the details of the law. 

These companies know what they are doing. They aren’t going to ban companies like Apple or Samsung. Samsung isn’t going to change how they do business or build phone last, but Apple is being vilified because they publicly announced their position. 

Apple already makes phones with replaceable batteries as do other companies such as Samsung. No, it’s not super easy to do on your own, but they are replaceable and Apple would rather provide the tools for free for DIY than go through a design change or weaken its water resistance, etc. This will also be the same for Samsung, but nobody wants to talk about that…

This law is designed for these cheap ass throw away phones that are designed to be discarded after use and not repaired, because they are cheap. The media isn’t reporting on that though; they just mention Apple and the people go nuts because iPhones have never had user replaceable batteries like the early Samsung Galaxy phones.",Slim706,2,1691054686.0

2. They had a major customer in samsung because of their custom cpu, snapdragon was an amazing chip in addition to their modem
3. Because they were so good at custom cpu, they pursued 64bit arm server soc, probably had customers lined up
4. Then bang, apple released a product with 64 bit cpu, then samsung wanted it yesterday
5. Qualcomm CMO said 64 bit arm cpu is a marketing gimmick, he got pushed to the corner of the exec rooms
6. Qualcomm goes full steam ahead on 64bit but it was too late
7. Then comes the battle of the board, jana partners wanted to break Qualcomm into two pieces, money cow license business and loss making cpu gpu soc business 
8. They give up, fire people from cpu division, execs were fired
9. Then they fire their server cpu division and close raleigh design centre

14yonfp,New EU regulations mandate user-replaceable batteries in Apple products,"iPhones aren’t even that hard to repair yourself anyway. The only difficult part is getting the screen off and it just literally requires you to be CAREFUL while removing it. There’s are tons of people that THINK they can do and very few that actually can. These are the same people that know full well they could change their own oil but still take it someplace and pay to have it done. 

Forget apple for a second, a lithium ion battery is typically rated for 1000 charge cycles, it’ll take you 3 years to get there on average but that’s not to say you won’t experience loss of battery life before that (there’s a difference in battery health and battery reliability) so most people will only ever likely replace their battery on their device once before opting to get a new device. There are people that do not care about upgrading their devices and that’s fine for them, they might be able to replace their battery maybe 3 times over the complete life cycle (we are talking 7-8 years) but I think it’s a win for consumers only in spirit. Repairing mobile phones or tablets that are almost a decade old…isn’t really financially a good option for most people and it’s likely the software won’t be supported either.
Companies that buy devices from you will be lowering the value once non-OEM parts are discovered (don’t fool yourselves in to thinking they won’t). Genuine parts are expensive and a lot of people look at the price of an item and associate it with value; if your Samsung device has a broken screen but it has really high refresh rate and you can only afford a screen with a lower refresh rate, that could likely be of great value to you but it also significantly lowers the value of the phone over all. 

Im don’t really know what this law expects to achieve unless it’s a pathway for repairs that are for more expensive equipment like John Deere tractors. Does this law expect e-waste to be affected? You can recycle computers and printers and phones at various locations for free (apple and Best Buy are the first to come to mind) but I still see people throw them away in normal trash all the time.",RastaImp0sta,-6,1689296852.0

16nk2kg,"iFixit retracts its iPhone 14's repairability score of 7 and gives it a ""4-not recommended""","**TLDR:** iFixit, a well-known parts repair website, recently lowered its repairability score for the iPhone 14 from 7 to 4. The decision came after discovering that even though the phone's hardware is more accessible, there are challenges when using unauthorized or unpaired parts for repairs. Apple's repair process now involves a software verification step, which can be problematic for local repair shops using non-Apple parts or failing to go through the official validation process.

**Key Points:**
- iFixit changed its iPhone 14 repairability score from a 7 (recommended) to a 4 (not recommended).
- The initial high score was given based on easy access and disassembly of the phone's hardware.
Repairs now often require authorization from Apple.
- After a repair, Apple's System Configuration tool needs to ""validate"" the fix through a ""software handshake"" or ""part pairing.""
- The tool ensures that repairs use genuine Apple parts and have been pre-informed to Apple.
- Failure to use Apple parts or skip the validation process results in software alerts that limit phone functionality.
- This repair process is especially challenging for smaller repair shops, which often use functional components from broken devices.
- Some repair professionals have opted to stop offering iPhone repairs because of these challenges.
- iFixit is revising its repairability scoring system to account for software limitations on self-repair.
- Apple's stance on repairs has improved from previous years, but concerns remain.

I keep seeing that it should have MacOS, but I don’t really get that. The average consumer are using these to consume media and productivity. There isn’t really a market for full blown tablet PCs and if there was, we’d see the Surface, one of the main and widely known products, sell a lot better than it does. Keeping iPadOS reduces the risk of cannibalizing sales across their Mac line￼, it makes more sense for them to keep improving iPad OS (and besides, Procreate works so well because it was made for iPads, I really don’t feel like finally getting the creative programs I wanted, but turns out they just smacked their desktop app over and called it a day.

1632lip,"The iPad Pro could get bigger screens and OLED next year, but it should do more | Rumors point to larger, OLED iPad Pros next year — welcome changes to be sure, but it’s hard not to want more of Apple’s tablets.","A [12.9” M2 iPad Pro](https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MNXT3LL/A), 256 GB storage (8 GB memory on that storage tier) with (iPad) Magic Keyboard is $1548 USD.

A [13” M2 MacBook Air](https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MLXY3LL/A?opt.power_adapter_aos_phantom_z15w=065-CD7F&opt.keyboard_and_documentation_z15w=065-CD0C&opt.memory_aos_phantom_z15w=065-CD5J&opt.processor_and_graphics_aos_phantom_z15w=065-CCJV&opt.hard_drivesolid_state_drive_aos_phantom_z15w=065-CCJY), 256 GB storage and 24 GB memory, is $1599 USD. (And that’s 3x the memory of the iPad Pro.)

Almost the same price but the MacBook has far more capability given Apple’s arbitrary constraints on iPadOS. iPad Pro gives you a rear camera array and the ability to switch between “laptop” and tablet form factors, sure. But you’re paying for that with the loss of fully differentiated browser options and the limitations of Stage Manager (since they e limited the available memory) versus full multitasking on macOS. With full fledged macOS apps. And what is frustrating is that Apple did this themselves. They set up the comparison and conflict when they introduced keyboards for iPads but have halted short of actually creating a touchscreen MacBook or an iPad Pro that can run macOS apps. What’s more, to fully take advantage of that touchscreen, you need the Apple Pencil 2nd Generation for an *additional* $129 USD bringing us to $1677. Camera and tablet mode just don’t seem worth it when you’re paying *more* money for *less* capability.

The weird parallel but asymptotic path makes a little more sense with iPad Air. The [Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil for iPad Air 256 GB] (https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MM9P3LL/A) set up costs $1177 USD ($1027 if you can get by with 64 GB). Here you’re trading raw capability for (arguably) overall versatility *and* a significantly lower price — about three-quarters. That’s at least a solid “jack of all trades” or “MacOS Lite” argument. Putting the M-series in the iPads Pro now just feels odd — overpowered for iPadOS and somehow also limited by being restricted to 8 GB memory.

The iPad Pro is just in this weird place. Putting the latest M-series in the iPads Pro just feels off now — overpowered for arbitrary iPadOS app limitations and somehow also limited by being restricted to 8 GB memory. Why have all that horsepower and nowhere to run? It’s sooo close to a damn near perfect Apple device but they seem to be arbitrarily holding it back to not cannibalize MacBook sales. Yet if they increased the memory to 16 GB (or 24!) and improved the Stage Manager limitations, without increasing the price *too* much?

They could hit that Nintendo Switch sweet spot and more intuitively command the higher price compared to a MacBook, when it has equivalent specs *and* more versatility. They’ve come so close. And then stoped short like they’re afraid of their own product",Sylvurphlame,2,1693207995.0

It can sit for months between uses. 

I watch movies on my phone when I could just as easily watch them on the iPad.

I read books on the iPad. The speed of the screen's response is so much better than e-ink, plus the books I read are textbooks, so the phone or small e-ink thing won't cut it. 

But if textbooks started to come out elegantly formatted for the phone, my ipad use would plummet even more.

I also watch video lectures involving things like programming where they have screens and I need to see the text.

If you put me in charge of apple watch, Macbook, mini, AR, iphone development I have a long list of things I would fix or add. But with my iPad about the only thing I would change about my older one would be way more storage. 

As head of iPad design I would sit in my office despondently as all my sub designers would keep coming in with newer and cooler features and I would just say, ""Does anyone care? Why don't we just put that in the iPhone?""

But, I suspect there is something the iPad could rock at where an iPhone or laptop just aren't a good fit.

17ve0tb,Nothing Phone (2) becomes first Android smartphone to receive official Apple iMessage support.,"I got to see the iMessage revolution first hand. I was in mobile sales for 7 years and the first year I joined was when the iPhone 4s launched. I sold iPhones from the 4S all the way up to the iPhone X. I was working for Sprint, and they were the first ones to start the ""iPhone forever"" program with the iPhone 6, people were switching their entire families over from Android to iPhone because the kids wanted the iPhones and yearly upgrades. Most parents would say they wouldn't take advantage of the annual upgrade themselves, but they would always be back in a year and would typically get new phones for everybody at the same time.

Then I would start seeing people come in every year and I would notice more people wanting to trade their Androids in early to get an iPhone because their kids told them to. 

One or more kids would switch to an iPhone, then parents would usually switch as well so they could tell when their kids were reading their messages. I remember that being a big thing for quite a few parents we're really into when they first released that feature in an update. 

It was the yearly iPhone upgrade that cemented most people with apples ecosystem of products. The kids eventually convince the parents because not only was Apple's product easier to use for most people and was consistent when Android phones were still somewhat complicated and new for first or second generation smartphone users. 

It only took like 2 years before people were getting everything Apple. Replacing their computers and their tablets with iOS and Mac devices. Once people committed for a year or two they typically stayed and don't want to switch back.

We had a butt ton of returns within the 14-day exchange window because people would be Apple people and want to try an Android with maybe three out of ten people actually switching OS. And five to six  people switching from Android to iOS and staying.

TLDR, I sold phones for years and when Sprint started doing annual upgrades with iPhones, kids would get their parents to switch over everybody wanted the annual upgrade, parents really liked the delivered and read function in iOS and in about 2 years everybody had picked an operating system and stuck with it",4got2takemymeds,8,1700008212.0

\- Only thing I can think of is performance will be affected. (Downclocking the hardware)

Anyone report performance degradation after the update?

Quick google search:

In a statement to media outlets, Apple is confident that the issue is related to software rather than the A17 Pro chip or titanium enclosure. The company has targeted three possible reasons for the overheating in some iPhone 15 Pro models:  
  
Apple says iPhones “may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity.” That’s a fairly common issue with new smartphones but appears to have been exasperated with the iPhone 15 launch.  
Some apps (including Instagram and Uber) that were recently updated to support iOS 17 have been overloading the A17 Pro chip’s CPU. Apple says it is working with affected developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out.  
A bug in iOS 17 that is “impacting some users” will be addressed in a future software update.  
Apple insists that the overheating issues aren’t related to the A17 Pro processor, iPhone 15’s titanium chassis, or its updated internal design. The company also squashed a report from Ming-Chi Kuo that it could limit performance to keep the system-on-chip cool under heavier loads, saying it “will not be lowering the performance of the A17 Pro chip” as part of the planned fixes.",iMogal,-9,1696455080.0

I've been using a pro with my various drones over the past couple of years and for about a year now even with the 14 pro she overheats way too quickly! I can literally fly my drone for five minutes in the shade 75° outside and the screen will dim by more than 50% which is kind of important seeing how I'm doing the whole you know flying a drone?! If this continues I will cease using iOS devices and switch to something different I would rather have the phone crash completely then literally have me squinting harder than that woman from the where's the beef commercial at my screen trying to figure out where I am.

AR solves a problem—one Apple itself helped create—the “need” to rely on a phone.

Which requires you to pull it out, unlock it, maybe even open an app to do something like take a picture or look something up. In the words of Jobs talking about how antiquated a stylus feels—*yeuch*.

Apple Glass, on the other hand? Or rather, on no hand at all.

Eye tracking: better and better improved over time with FaceID, so it knows where you’re looking.

Gestures: they’re the king of gestures, and why not bring that knowledge to the micro actions of the eye?

Object identification: you can tap and hold subjects in an image to isolate them from the rest of the photograph already… Can the processing be done now on the fly?

Maps you don’t have to look at your wrist or phone for anymore.

13q01po,Apple Invites XR Media Outlets to WWDC Keynote for the First Time - Practically Confirming Rumored VR/AR Headset Reveal,"Can save you the unveiling hype and tell you exactly what it be:

-A device that is $100-200 more than the Meta Quest 2 (or whatever similar model is their main VR competitor, they’ll keep this $100-200 difference to maintain brand superiority because “Apple”

-will only work within the Apple ecosystem

-will use a proprietary charger that is expensive to replace and breaks easily

-will be slightly smaller than the Quest 2 and they will tout portability as a feature, but it will be nowhere near google glass levels of portability.

-battery life will mediocre since I imagine they’ll slim down the size by cutting out battery size.

-screen resolution will be fine. Apple standard, nothing crazy. Doubt we get Retina or similar level display in a 1st gen product, will likely just be a normal OLED display.

-will have poor gaming support since Apple is a prude and won’t let Sony, Microsoft, or Samsung integrate with their devices

-could potentially coincide with Apple launching their own gaming studio to get around poor gaming support from third-parties

-will be fragile and easily breakable per Apple standard







I would be EXTREMELY surprised if they unveil anything with actual value as a first-gen product. For me to consider purchasing, I’d need it to be under $300, have good third-party integrations, be at least *slightly* durable, have good battery life, use USB-C, and be significantly smaller than Quest 2 and legitimately portable.

Edit: I see I have offended the Apple fanboys by comparing their last few product releases to what could be expected at this one. My apologies, didn’t mean to ruin your “iphone moment” for the VR industry",leroyyyyyjenkinsssss,-45,1684886563.0

On July 1st, 2023, Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed. This move will require developers of third-party
applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications (which include
browsers like Reddit Is Fun, moderation tools like Pushshift, and accessibility-focused add-ons for users who are visually
impaired) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable
than it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.

Reddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on
uncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact 
both groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; 
without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting 
creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an 
ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit – the fixtures which make it
appealing – will be eliminated.

We implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has
allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not
tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no 
thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman's statement – ""I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our
shareholders to be users"" – is to be taken seriously, then please consider this our vote:

Allow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access.

Allow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.

13ku7xx,Apple to Mass Produce Its Own MicroLED Displays for iPhones,"This actually makes a lot of sense as the article mentions.

> According to the outlet's sources, Apple has spent at least $1 billion on microLED research and development over past decade

No display manufacturer has been willing to mass produce a small MicroLED panel. Despite the technology making every other display technology redundant the sheer cost of constructing the manufacturing has been daunting leading many to wait for costs to go down.

For Apple's future mixed reality projects it is almost guaranteed they need these manufacturing processes perfected. For reference, future headsets will be aiming for 16K per eye displays and MicroLED is the only known technology that can get there. It allows near atomically thin lightweight displays that can get close to matching the sun outside.

Expect when Apple pushes this that every other company begins their own manufacturing. It'll take a while though, but the benefits will be insane. Sadly the processing power, even with foveated rendering, means even if the displays exist it could be a decade or longer until they're fully utilized.

16jedaq,Apple's new Lightning to USB-C adapter is hilariously expensive,"This article is frustrating because there is a use case for this kind of dongle, and it's not that expensive in comparison.

Anker sells the [same dongle](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Lightning-Probably-Certified/dp/B07HVBYDYY?th=1) for $20 (Lightning to USB C) - but it only supports audio - and not charging. This cable, for an additional $10, supports audio, data, and power. There are adapters for Lightning to USB C that only do power for \~10 bucks. But those don't support audio or data. This Apple adapter does audio, power, and data - and that combination in a single dongle *did not exist before.*

With this dongle, you can make use of any accessories that use Lightning, and still be able to use all of your existing Lightning power cables as you migrate to USB C.

Does everyone need this? Of course not. The vast majority of iPhone users only use Lightning for power and should buy USB C cables or the cheaper power-only adapters for their existing cables.

But for folks who currently rely on Lightning accessories and/or have a plethora of Lightning cables, this is not a bad price for an adapter that did not exist before - especially when compared to an 'existing' usb c to Lightning dongle that only does audio for $20.",bunsenfhoneydew,102,1694791314.0

16jedaq,Apple's new Lightning to USB-C adapter is hilariously expensive,"Just to share some perspective here, while Apple's is a premium product of course, it is not so outrageous considering what it pays for:

-- You get a thoroughly tested cable and guarantee from a very reputable company, with assurances that it will work as you expect and be fixed if not

-- You know that the company will still be around next year, versus some fly by night no name vendor on Amazon that has no promise of continuing to exist, physically or even virtually

-- You receive a product that has been more carefully sourced, produced, with all the obligations that a bigger company has to not abuse its workers, etc.  

etc. etc. 

Not saying that Apple isn't making a profit, of course it is, on top of all this.  And it's of course taking advantage of you already being in the store to make some extra as you buy other Apple products that tied you into their ecosystem.    But a lot of the cheaper stuff out there are really cutting corners on the above, and when you get a product that doesn't work, you get to experience why.",kepler1,4,1694800049.0

18o0ge0,Apple Won't Be Able to Repair Out-of-Warranty Apple Watches Due to Import Ban,"From the article: When the Apple Watch import ban goes into effect after December 25, 2023, Apple will not be able to repair out-of-warranty Apple Watch models in the United States. Apple Watch repairs typically involve replacing a broken unit with a new model rather than fixing an individual component, and replacement devices will not be available.

Apple shared the news with retail employees in a memo that was sent out this week. Portions of the memo were seen by MacRumors, and it was also shared by Bloomberg. Apple is set to stop all U.S. online sales of the Apple Watch in just a few hours, with in-store sales to cease after December 24.

1751mwq,Swiss study shows Apple Watch produces best ECG quality and readability,"The comments here are absolutely awful. Good god. I’ll try to add something meaningful.

The AppleInsider article has managed to cherry-pick probably the least interesting or meaningful finding from [the original study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37769610/). The authors provide it essentially as an aside, since they did actually measure it but it didn’t meaningfully explain any other finding.

Here are some findings that actually did matter:

- atrial fibrillation can be challenging to diagnose, and accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) improve with both experience over a career and experience with a set task. Consultant cardiologists were far better at it than medical students, as you’d expect, but they also did better on the last five ECGs in a set compared to the first five.
- there was no meaningful difference between different devices at the chance of accurately diagnosing atrial fibrillation
- despite this, the participants *subjectively* preferred the data presentation from the Apple Watch although this didn’t actually make them perform any better at the task at hand.

To expand on this last point, the original study reads:

“No significant difference in the accuracy of atrial fibrillation detection was seen between the five smart devices; p = 0.33. SL-ECGs from the Apple Watch were considered as having the best quality and readability by 203 (45%) and 226 (50%) participants, respectively.”

To boil that down: people thought that the Apple Watch gave the best data, but that *did not translate into better performance at diagnosing AF*. Not only was there no significant difference, a p-value of 0.33 means that the results were *extremely* clear that there’s no best device for this purpose.

AppleInsider has managed, ironically, to take a finding that’s purely about user experience and blow it out of proportion when the authors themselves explicitly say it doesn’t matter to the primary outcome of a patient receiving an accurate diagnosis.

Month by month AppleCare+ is indefinite until you cancel, no maximum time limit; it costs more than the 2-year rate over time, [monthly costs more after 20 months](https://www.apple.com/support/products/watch/), but if you’re like me and don’t upgrade in under 2 years (I have an AppleCare+ covered Series3 I got in May ‘21 and am just now upgrading to the Series9), that will at least provide a safety net, especially since they’re only refusing to touch out-of-warranty watches.",bootymix96,25,1703213042.0

The main problem is end goal of the manufacturer's of each device. Samsung, Motorola, Oppo, etc their goal is to sell more hardware. So Although they make good phones, they do not push out updates after a few years to these devices to create a planned obsolescence.

Apple on the other hand changed their goal from planned obsolescence ( AKA: batterygate) to a goal of keeping people in their ""Walled Garden"" and sell more services rather than sell more hardware.

Android phones are not more powerful like they used to be.  They don't have better battery life anymore.   And if you want top specs you're pretty much forced to buy Samsung, which is completely locked down with tons of bloatware. That means no more rooting, custom firmware, UI customization etc.  And if you do manage to get root access then they will lock you out of your banking apps and anything which requires payment verification.  It's like all the drawbacks of being in the walled garden but with none of the benefits.   I can't even uninstall Facebook from my 1400$ android.

10st1fq,Why Apple Watches Keep Calling 911 - The New York Times,"From a story on DNYUZ:

> FRISCO, Colo. — On a recent sunny Sunday morning, following a night of fluffy snowfall, tens of thousands of skiers flocked to the resorts of Summit County. Just minutes after the lift lines opened, sirens began blaring in the 911 emergency service center, where four staff members were taking calls and dispatching help.

> Each jarring alert was a new incoming call, heralding a possible car crash, heart attack or other life-threatening situation. Often, the phone operators heard a chilling sound at the far end of the line: silence, perhaps from a caller too incapacitated to respond.

> At 9:07 a.m., one dispatcher, Eric Betts, responded to such a call. From the map on one of the seven monitors on his desk, he could see that the distress call originated from a slope at the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area. Mr. Betts tried calling back. A man picked up.

> “Do you have an emergency?” Mr. Betts asked. No, the man said, he was skiing — safely, happily, unharmed. Slightly annoyed, he added, “For the last three days, my watch has been dialing 911.”

> Winter has brought a decent amount of snowfall to the region’s ski resorts, and with it an avalanche of false emergency calls. Virtually all of them have been placed by Apple Watches or iPhone 14s under the mistaken impression that their owners have been debilitated in collisions.

> “My whole day is managing crash notifications,” said Trina Dummer, interim director of Summit County’s emergency services, which received 185 such calls in the week from Jan. 13 to Jan. 22. (In winters past, the typical call volume on a busy day was roughly half that.) Ms. Dummer said that the onslaught was threatening to desensitize dispatchers and divert limited resources from true emergencies.

> Just before noon, Mark Watson, a sergeant with the sheriff’s office, walked into the dispatch room looking glum. “This is not a good day,” he said.

> Ordinarily, he had other duties, including patrolling the backcountry on snowmobile, but the ghost calls had kept him at his desk. Whenever the 911 operators were unable to reach the owner of the watch or phone, the case was referred to Sergeant Watson, who would try calling and sending a text; if he didn’t hear back, he forwarded the issue to the ski patrol.

> So far that day, Sergeant Watson had fielded seven referrals from 911, four of which he forwarded to the ski patrol. He turned to Ms. Dummer: How many crash-detection calls had come in overall? Eleven, she said, out of 30 calls total.

First off, if your watch has been repeatedly making false calls to 911 for three days then take off the watch or turn it off. You KNOW it is making bogus calls, after the first two or three it is time to start issuing fines.

Second, the obvious reaction is already happening:

> In Grand County, home to a busy mountain called Winter Park, Sheriff Brett Schroetlin decided in late December to devote less attention to the crash-detection calls. Now if a 911 operator receives one from the slopes and no one is on the other end of the line, they know to ignore the call; no more referrals or follow-ups. None of the ghost calls so far have been real emergencies, Sheriff Schroetlin reasoned, and he couldn’t afford to waste limited resources. Besides, he said, there was a better technology: human beings.",TheQuarantinian,23,1675464132.0

Yes, and an RTX 4070 Ti costs approx £800 as opposed to approx £5,600 for the M2 Ultra.

Surely that's like saying Hey wow my Ferrari is faster than your affordable family car!?

I have a lot of respect for Toms Hardware, but if the title of this post is meant to make me think Apple is the better option, then surely the PRICE should be taken into account?

For a work system you won’t know why your app keeps locking up or crashing or choking on the biggest files. When it’s new you won’t notice because you’ll chalk it up to bugs in apps not updated yet but a year in when it’s stable it will choke on you when you are constantly using most of its ram for the apps you use daily. It’s the ram and limited hard drives space. So you are looking at a minimum $500 up charge to have a work capable workhorse. Paying $500 more for a Mac over base price has been almost mandatory (if you let Apple do your upgrades) for decades. It’s their best grift outside of having very low cost production costs for the higher quality materials and production labor they use. Not upgrading ram and drive space on a Mac is really a waste of a computer because they are extremely capable systems when maxed out.

The computational power of the Neural Engine has also doubled and the GPU now supports hardware ray tracing. The media engine also has added support for AV1 decoding.  
It's clear Apple have invested into other things than CPU speed. which makes sense as they still compare with desktop chips. As such there is little gained from the end-user perspective (this generation) to focus solely on CPU speed. Apple clearly deemed other areas more important.

178udec,Apple may cut EyeSight display and Mac chip for its cheaper Vision Pro,"From the article: If Apple does release a cheaper Vision Pro headset, it’s likely to be a stripped-down version with fewer external cameras, no EyeSight feature and an iPhone chip in place of the current Mac chip. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported in his Power On newsletter that the company is looking at these options as ways to bring the cost down to between $1,500 and $2,500 for a lower-end model. Apple Vision Pro, which is set to begin shipping in early 2024, currently starts at an eye-watering $3,500.

In an earlier report, Gurman said the cheaper Vision Pro would also use lower resolution displays inside the headset. The big indication now is that it may drop the external display that enables its signature EyeSight feature, according to Gurman. EyeSight projects the wearer’s eyes onto an outward-facing OLED display so anyone who approaches can see where their attention is focused. It was one of major selling points in Apple's Vision Pro announcement, though it isn’t exactly mission critical.

According to Gurman, a follow-up to the premium Vision Pro is in the works already, too. That will have EyeSight, and potentially a more lightweight design that opts for built-in prescription lenses for those who need it rather than the Zeiss inserts it’s working with now.",chrisdh79,36,1697419320.0

178udec,Apple may cut EyeSight display and Mac chip for its cheaper Vision Pro,"I’m both surprised and not that it’s not cheaper, much cheaper.

Apple have the war chest to make this thing, or a version of it at least, a loss leader in the same way that Sony got Blu-ray drives into millions of people’s homes - winning the HD format war - by selling the PS3 at a loss.

As it is it’s far too expensive for most consumers, even in its anticipated cut down form. I’d argue even $1000 is too much for a device that no one strictly needs, unlike a phone.

I guess “loss leader” isn’t in Apple’s vocabulary, but I feel like that’s what it would take for this to have any chance of mainstream traction.

Apple are not immune to missteps, the Touch Bar, the original butterfly keyboards, HomePod, etc. If this thing only ever exists in the rarified atmosphere of tech geeks with money to burn, then it’s going to die on the vine.

I do think of all the VR/AR experiences Apple does stand the best chance of convincing the general public that this is actually something they might want, largely due to the saturation of their other products and interoperability, but it’s still a tall order.

16muhcz,The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max debut today with notable improvements and solid reviews,"I've been on Android for a long time now. Mostly happy with it, though I've been thinking of possibly switching. Mostly because a lot of my extended family have iPhones, and Apple has worked to inject just a little bit of friction there. Like the dumb way it treats text messages between iPhones and other phones. And beyond that, they are always bumping their phones  together to share wifi info, air dropping, etc. Lots of little things that I do not care much about, but slowly add up.

They also always had different charging cables than me, but I suppose that will at least be changing now.

Them going to USB-C was one of the things I decided I wanted before switching. They have done that now, but somehow managed to still make it charge slower than my current, 4-year-old phone.

So... we'll see. I've mostly decided that, if I can convince myself this is the best phone camera on the market (ignoring zoom), I'll go ahead and make the switch. At the moment it seems like a bit of a toss-up. Which I suppose I should have expected.",USeaMoose,23,1695147381.0

I have to imagine, purely in my humble opinion, that the 15 Pro will be the last phone I ever need for at least 5 years. Obviously the battery perhaps will need to get replaced after year 2 or 3, but from a technological and hardware perspective, how much more can they improve to require me to pay another $1000 or whatever it's going to be? 

Without drastically changing the form factor and overall size, what really can be done in terms of mobile camera sensors? It's never going to be a DSLR or mirrorless camera simply due to physics.

16736jn,iPhone 16 OLED Panels May Use Micro-Lens Technology to Increase Brightness and Power Efficiency,"After supporting exclusively Apple since the iPhone 4, I traded my iPhone 12 Pro Max for a Samsung S23 Ultra and have no regrets.

I created a list of iPhone/ios annoyances that quickly became over 2 screens long.  Screen brightness was on the top of my list.  Apple ignores all ios settings and decreases brightness according to device temperature.  So when outside, during the day, under the crazy bright sun, when screen brightness is most important, Apple ignores all user settings and dims the screen.

I called Apple and was told that this is one of the two most complained about ""features"" (the other being Apple's new policy to look at all iCloud photos and video under the guise of catching child porn).

Basically, newer iPhones are unusable outdoors during the day, and Apple no longer values/protects customer privacy while Google/Android has become more secure.

Without pasting my entire list of gripes, the main idea is that Apple creates and enforces ""intuitive features"" that I generally don't appreciate.

I still own an iPad, so losing the few ios-exclusive apps wasn't too bad.  I'll use my iPad for these apps until I find Android alternatives. I love the greater amount of control and customization that Android provides.

My Samsung is crazy bright, even outdoors when it's most important, has never overheated, and has more battery life than my old iPhone.  Ironically, I think Samsung manufactures iPhone screens.

_________________
Another iPhone pet peeve is how ios handles large files.

I recorded my daughter's middle school musical, and while my iPhone did an amazing job recording 1080p video in a dark gymnasium, Apple provides no way to transfer large files directly to a computer for editing.  I don't know where Apple draws the line, but at some point, connecting an iPhone to a computer via a lightning cable will not work.  Obviously, there is no SD card in an iPhone to transfer either, so what does Apple expect you to do?  Upload the huge file to iCloud and then download it from the computer.  So, my huge file travels thousands of miles to go about a foot from my iPhone to my laptop.  I assume this is because lightning cables are slow at data transfer, but what if you're in an area with slow or no internet?",MPQuietSe7en,-2,1693603483.0

11e67uz,"iPhone 16 Pro Still on Track to Feature Under-Display Face ID, Followed By Under-Display Selfie Camera in 2026","I’m hoping Apple will have brought out a foldable phone by 2026. I have an iPhone 13 Pro and last year was the first year I didn’t upgrade to the latest iPhone because it wasn’t worth the money to me to do so when the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro look so similar. I couldn’t justify paying more than £600 to upgrade just so I could have dynamic Island and better cameras when the cameras on the 13 Pro are already good. The iPhone Pro looks like a boring design compared to the Samsung foldable phones. I’ve tried to use android Samsung phones in the past but I don’t like using android, the Samsung phones eventually developed a fault and then the resell value on them was always much worse than an iPhone.",gregRichards2002,0,1677623537.0

The only phones that really do it are the Samsung galaxy fold line and the ZTE Axon ultra line. Both of which have under display cameras that are barely passable for a video call.
